# Candle Shop Fixes - JavaScript Error and Feature Removal

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ JavaScript Error: `candleShop.nextSlide is not a function`
**Problem:** The index.ejs was calling `candleShop.nextSlide()` and `candleShop.prevSlide()` but these functions were missing from the `candle-shop-enhanced-fixed.js` file.

**Solution:** 
- Added complete carousel functionality with `nextSlide()` and `prevSlide()` methods to the CandleShop class
- Added global wrapper functions `nextSlide()` and `prevSlide()` for onclick handlers
- Implemented proper carousel interval management with `resetCarouselInterval()`
- Added smooth slide transitions and dot navigation synchronization

### 2. ✅ Removed Product Comparison Feature
**Removed:**
- `showComparison()` function from CandleShop class
- Comparison floating action button from index.ejs
- `compare-count` styling from CSS
- Comparison-related global variables (`compareList`)

### 3. ✅ Removed Recently Viewed Feature  
**Removed:**
- `showRecentlyViewed()` function from CandleShop class
- Recently viewed floating action button from index.ejs
- Recently viewed global variables (`recentlyViewed`)
