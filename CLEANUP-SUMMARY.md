## 🎯 LANDING.CSS OPTIMIZATION DETAILS

### What Was Removed/Optimized
1. ✅ **Duplicate CSS variables** - Already defined in style.css
2. ✅ **Redundant reset rules** - Using base styles from style.css
3. ✅ **Over-specific selectors** - Simplified to use inheritance
4. ✅ **Repeated media queries** - Consolidated into fewer blocks
5. ✅ **Excessive comments** - Kept only essential section markers
6. ✅ **Duplicate animations** - Removed redundant keyframes
7. ✅ **Unused utility classes** - Removed classes not referenced in templates
8. ✅ **Grid mesh background** - Moved to base styles
9. ✅ **Multiple contact/map styles** - Simplified to essential only
10. ✅ **Redundant hover effects** - Used consistent patterns

### What Was Kept
1. ✅ All hero carousel styles (essential for homepage)
2. ✅ Impact section with card animations
3. ✅ Team section grid and cards

5. ✅ Feeds/reel section with horizontal scroll
6. ✅ Testimonials carousel
7. ✅ Newsletter section styles
8. ✅ Loading screen animations
9. ✅ All responsive breakpoints
10. ✅ Accessibility features (reduced motion, print styles)

### Optimization Techniques Used

2. **Selector Shortening** - Used `inset: 0` instead of `top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0`
3. **Clamp() for Responsive** - Used `clamp()` for fluid typography
4. **Combined Selectors** - Merged similar rules
5. **Removed Vendor Prefixes** - Modern browsers don't need most prefixes
6. **Simplified Animations** - Kept only actively used keyframes
7. **Grid Auto-Fit** - Used smarter grid patterns
8. **Removed Redundant States** - Consolidated hover/focus states
