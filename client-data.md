## Leadership

### Founder & Director: Sangita Mehra

**Background:** Of the Mehrasons Jewellers family, Sangita is the driving force behind Spread A Smile. Originally a fashion designer/entrepreneur, she gave up her business to devote herself to social work.

**Motivation:** Sangita was moved by the plight of street children in Delhi. She decided to "lose herself in the service of others," aiming to give at-risk kids "basic amenities like food, clothes and shelter" and eventually mainstream them into school. This maternal compassion and determination to "spread a better life for them" underpins her mission.

**Leadership Role:** Sangita continues to lead the NGO's activities and programs. External collaborators describe the NGO as "led by the lovely Sangita Mehra". Under her guidance, the organization has expanded from an informal street initiative into a structured educational program and community centre.

**Background & Education:** Details on Sangita's formal education are not publicly documented. She leveraged her experience in business and fashion to mobilize resources for vulnerable children.

## Establishment & Origin (2005–2006)

**Year Founded:** Spread A Smile India was founded around 2005–2006 (approximately 20 years ago from 2025).

**Inception Story:** Sangita Mehra started the project with her older son, Aashray, as a grassroots effort to help street children in their neighbourhood. Initially operating under the auspices of the family's Mehrasons Jewellers Charitable Trust, the NGO began very modestly. Sangita recounts that she started with 10 local street children, providing them with food, clothing, and shelter. This small-scale initiative marked the birth of Spread A Smile's mission.

**Early Operations:** In the early years, the focus was on immediate relief – feeding, clothing, and caring for these children. Gradually, the NGO added informal classes and counseling to build trust. Within a year or two, the initiative began connecting families with government schools, planting the seed for what would become a full education-focused program.

## Mission, Vision & Core Values

**Mission:** To uplift and educate destitute street children, helping them transition "from streets to classrooms." The NGO aims for the "overall improvement of underprivileged kids", ensuring they get basic needs and access to formal education. This is achieved through schooling support, healthcare, nutrition, and emotional care.

**Vision:** A future in which every child born in poverty can break the cycle of destitution. Spread A Smile envisions self-reliant, educated youth who no longer beg at traffic signals but attend school and later hold steady jobs. Long-term, it seeks to erase street child behavior by providing alternatives and opportunities.

**Core Values:** Compassion, dignity, and empowerment. The organization operates on principles of empathy, integrity, and inclusion. Education is treated as the first step toward empowerment. The NGO also emphasizes community and gratitude, reflecting a culture of public-private partnership and volunteerism.

## Target Beneficiaries and Community Served

**Primary Beneficiaries:** Destitute street children in and around Munirka, Delhi. The program focuses on children who live on the streets, often begging at traffic lights or scavenging to survive. These children are typically between 4 and 17 years old. The NGO actively identifies kids who have dropped out or never attended school, and works to bring them into the education system.

**Secondary Beneficiaries:** Families and women from local slums. Many beneficiaries come from marginalized slum communities. Spread A Smile has extended support to mothers and women in these areas by offering vocational training and employment opportunities. In one program, over 85 women from nearby slums were trained in handicrafts and micro-enterprise skills.

**Geographic Focus:** The core community served is Munirka Village (South Delhi) and surrounding low-income neighborhoods. Many children come from the Munirka basti (slum) area. The NGO occasionally reaches out to other parts of Delhi NCR in partnership events.

**Scale of Reach:** Spread A Smile has impacted hundreds of children. By 2016, around 170 children were regularly part of the program. A partner site later cites that "Spread A Smile has changed the lives of 300 children" in total. In summary, the beneficiaries are very low-income/urban poor children and their families, with an educational focus.

## Key Programs and Initiatives

### Education Support: Mainstream Schooling
Helping street children enroll in government schools is a flagship program. Spread A Smile provides admission assistance, monitors attendance, and interfaces between schools and families. By 2016, over 100 children successfully enrolled in school who otherwise would have remained begging. The NGO also supplies uniforms, books, stationery and tuition support as needed. Children attend classes, and volunteers or teachers sometimes conduct remedial classes. The emphasis is on reducing the dropout rate.

### Food and Nutrition: Nutritious Meals
The NGO ensures children receive at least one wholesome meal per day, critical for undernourished kids. Meals may be prepared at the center or arranged through partner programs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Spread A Smile coordinated relief for food security, including collaboration with Cosmo Foundation that delivered hundreds of kilograms of groceries to needy families in Delhi.

### Health and Wellness
Spread A Smile regularly arranges healthcare camps and awareness sessions for beneficiaries. Notable collaborations include Rotary Club of Delhi Safdarjung running a two-day Children's Day Health Camp (Nov 13–14, 2021) at Spread A Smile's Munirka centre. This camp offered 180+ blood tests and 54 ECGs, plus dental check-ups. Through such initiatives, the NGO addresses immediate health needs and promotes hygiene.

### Vocational Training & Empowerment
For older children and mothers, the NGO offers skills training to improve livelihood prospects. Ongoing efforts include teaching handicrafts (stitching, embroidery, candle-making) and basic entrepreneurship to youths and women. Through collaborations, women beneficiaries learned to craft and sell crochet bags, bottle holders and other products. Children learn crafts and trades in the evenings or on breaks, creating a path to jobs once they finish school.

### Special Events
Spread A Smile hosts and participates in thematic events to raise awareness and celebrate the children. Annual events include Children's Day parties, where children perform dances or plays for guests and sponsors. The NGO also celebrates Independence Day, Holi, Diwali, etc., often with modest cultural programs.

## Progress and Impact Metrics

**Children Enrolled in School:** By 2016, over 100 street children had been mainstreamed into government schools through Spread A Smile's efforts. The NGO tracks attendance and progress, reporting that the enrolled children largely "choose not to beg any longer". Since then, the number of school-going children has grown; partner communications suggest nearly 300 children have benefited overall.

**Current Enrollment:** As of the latest reports, the active program size is on the order of 250–300 children (ages 4–17).

**Women Empowered:** Over 85 women from slum communities have been taught vocational skills (crochet, handicrafts, baking, etc.). These women are employed through NGO projects, and the jobs provide them with regular income.

**Educational Milestones:** Anecdotal achievements include dozens of children passing class 10 exams, and several older boys and girls securing first jobs or vocational placements.

## Weekly/Recurring Events

**Volunteer Days:** Spread A Smile runs regular volunteer programmes at its Munirka centre. A particularly noted recurring activity is the Thursday Langar and Activity Day (traditional free kitchen meal), where volunteers prepare a meal and engage children with games or lessons.

**Classes and Tuition:** On weekdays and during school holidays, the centre often operates educational programs. In summer, children attend the centre daily. During the school year, teachers or volunteers may come for a few hours per week to tutor or do art and sports sessions.

**Community Outreach Meetings:** Once or twice a month, Spread A Smile organizes meetings with parents/families of beneficiaries. These gatherings involve progress reviews, fee or scholarship disbursement, and sharing educational materials.

## Partnerships and Collaborations

**Youth and Volunteers Groups:** Grassroots volunteer organizations like the Robin Hood Army and Youthreach India frequently engage with Spread A Smile.

**Schools and Community:** Local schools have supported the NGO through drives. Delhi Public School (Sec-84, Gurugram) students organized a community outreach to collect and donate clothes, toys, and stationery to Spread A Smile India.

**Corporate/Design Partners:** The fashion and corporate sectors have been vital collaborators. In a high-profile fundraising event at the Australian High Commission (2016), designers donated couture pieces to benefit the cause.

**NGO Alliances:** Spread A Smile occasionally partners with other NGOs. During COVID relief, the NGO partnered with Cosmo Foundation to distribute groceries to needy communities.

**Government/Diplomatic Support:** Diplomatic and government figures have shown support. The Australian High Commissioner's venue hosted the 2016 fundraiser.

## Achievements and Recognitions

## Team Members and Volunteers

**Core Team:** The registered NGO staff is small. Founder Sangita Mehra serves as President/Director. An informal "board" may include her family members (e.g. her son Aashray) and close associates. A handful of full-time staff manage daily operations: a centre coordinator, teachers/tutors, and a part-time accountant or admin.

**Volunteer Educators:** Many volunteer teachers and college students assist the children. These volunteers come from universities and NGO partners, providing remedial classes and fun learning activities.

**Medical Volunteers:** Doctors and health professionals periodically volunteer for camps.

**Other Volunteers:** Support roles are filled by corporate and community volunteers who run extracurricular clubs (art, dance, cricket) at the centre, and women volunteers who counsel mothers on hygiene and parenting.

## Fundraising Methods and Donor Engagement

**Fundraising Events:** The NGO's signature fundraising method is events. The 2016 gala fashion show (at the Australian High Commission) raised money for a vocational centre. Sangita hosts annual charity dinners and cultural shows, inviting diplomats, entrepreneurs and media.

**Corporate Sponsorships:** Spread A Smile engages corporate donors through CSR partnerships. Companies sponsor specific needs or match employee donations.

**Retail and E-commerce:** To raise funds and provide livelihoods, Spread A Smile has explored product sales. The Adora collaboration involved designer-crafted handbags made by beneficiary women sold at fairs, with proceeds going back to the women and NGO operations.

**Crowdfunding & Online Drives:** The NGO occasionally uses online platforms for specific campaigns. It also solicits donations via its social media pages.

**Donor Relations:** The NGO maintains good donor relations by sending success reports and photos. Annual newsletters highlight beneficiary stories.

## Social Media Presence

**Other Channels:** The founder Sangita Mehra also uses other platforms to highlight the NGO's work. Contact details and fundraising links are often provided via these platforms.

## Media Mentions and Public Coverage

Other lifestyle outlets have published short pieces and photo galleries on events hosted by Spread A Smile.

**Television & Videos:** A YouTube video by TEDxCoventGardenWomen (London) features Sangita's talk about Spread A Smile, increasing international visibility. Local TV channels have occasionally covered the NGO's community events.

**Awards/Features:** In 2019, the NGO was mentioned in the context of the NAI Achievement Awards, indicating a form of honorary recognition by a cultural organization.

## Future Plans and Goals

**Vocational Training Centre:** A top priority is establishing a permanent Vocational Training and Skill Development Centre. Plans include training in trades (tailoring, computers, hospitality) for older youth, and entrepreneurship workshops for women.

**Scaling Education:** Spread A Smile aims to broaden its educational reach. This means enrolling more children each year, expanding classes at the centre, and possibly opening a second branch or mobile outreach in another low-income locality.

**Digital and Remote Learning:** The NGO is looking to integrate digital tools. This could involve laptops/tablets at the centre or online classes for children who cannot physically attend.

**Long-Term Sustainability:** The NGO seeks financial sustainability through endowments or recurring corporate CSR funding, to avoid reliance on ad-hoc donations.

**Monitoring & Evaluation:** Another goal is to implement formal impact tracking (attendance records, exam results, alumni placement).

**Advocacy:** Spread A Smile hopes to use its experience to advocate for street children's rights.
