### Fix #8: Removed Route Conflicts with SEO Middleware ‚úÖ

  res.render('index', { 
    title: 'Home - Spread A Smile India',  // ‚Üê CONFLICTS!
    metaDescription: '...'  // ‚Üê CONFLICTS!
  });
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', { 
    page: 'home'
    // SEO middleware auto-injects title, metaDescription, keywords
